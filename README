AssistantExtensions source code
-------------------------------

For more info please visit the website.
You can use forums at http://ae.k3a.me/forum/viewforum.php?f=3.
I will also publish the list of task which would be good to have completed.

To Compile It
-------------
1. You need to have theos installed
2. Fix theos symlinks to your theos installation
3. Create frameworks directory and copy AssistantUI.framework and SAObjects.framework there. You can get these by extracting dyld shared cache (or maybe also from ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/iOS\ DeviceSupport..../Symbols/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks if you are a developer and have iPhone 4S - untested). I have used dyld_decache tool and extracted those from /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.dyld/dyld_shared_cache_armv7 which can be found in 4S firmwares or 4S filesystem).


Hopefully you will like the code!
